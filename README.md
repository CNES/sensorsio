# sensorsio

`sensorsio` is a python library that provides convenient functions to load Sentinel2 (Level 2A, MAJA format) and other sensors data into `numpy` and `xarray`. It supports on the fly reprojection to a user-defined grid, which makes it suitable for the building multi-modal datacubes.

# Licence

sensorsio is distributed under the Apache 2.0 licence, except from modules depending on pyresample, which are distributed under the LGPL v3 licence (irregulargrid.py, master.py, ecostress.py).

## Quickstart

### Reading a Sentinel2 product

Reading a **Sentinel2 L2A (MAJA format)** product is as simple as:

```python
# Import the sentinel 2 module
from sensorsio import sentinel2
# Create an instance of Sentinel2 class from the product path
dataset = sentinel2.Sentinel2('/datalake/S2-L2A-THEIA/31TDH/2019/05/31/SENTINEL2B_20190531-105916-927_L2A_T31TDH_C_V2-2/')
# Read bands, masks and coords to numpy
bands, masks, xcoords, ycoords, crs = dataset.read_as_numpy(sentinel2.Sentinel2.GROUP_10M)
# Read bands, masks and coords to xarray
xrds = dataset.read_as_xarray(sentinel2.Sentinel2.GROUP_10M)
print(xrds)
```
```

```
### Jointly reading multiple sensors on a common grid

It is also very simple to reproject several images from different sensors to a common grid for manipulation:

```python
# Create a Sentinel2 dataset
s2_ds = sentinel2.Sentinel2(s2)
# Create a Pleiades dataset
vns_ds = venus.Venus(vns)
# Find common grid
box, crs = utils.bb_common([s2_ds.bounds, vns_ds.bounds],[s2_ds.crs, vns_ds.crs],snap=10)

# Warp Sentinel2 on this grid:
s2_arr, _, _, _, _ = s2_ds.read_as_numpy(sentinel2.Sentinel2.GROUP_10M,
                                         resolution=10,
                                         crs=crs,
                                         bounds=box)
# Warp PlÃ©iades on this grid:
vns_arr, _, _, _ = phr_ds.read_as_numpy(venus.Venus.GROUP_5M,
                                        resolution=10,
                                        crs=crs,
                                        bounds=box,
                                        algorithm=rio.enums.Resampling.cubic)
print(vns_arr.shape, s2_arr.shape)
```
```
((4, 5774, 2082), (4, 5774, 2082))
```

### Visualisation made easy

`sensorsio` also contains utilities to prepare `numpy` arrays for visualisation with `matplotlib`:

```python
# Prepare for rendering (band extraction and scaling)
dmin = np.array([0., 0., 0.])
dmax = np.array([0.2,0.2,0.2])
s2_rgb, dmin, dmax = utils.rgb_render(s2_arr, bands=[2,1,0], 
                                      dmin=dmin, 
                                      dmax=dmax)
phr_rgb, dmin, max = utils.rgb_render(phr_arr, bands=[2,1,0], 
                                      dmin=dmin, 
                                      dmax=dmax)
 # Call matplotlib
 fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(int(25*phr_rgb.shape[1]/phr_rgb.shape[0]), 25))
axes[0].imshow(s2_rgb)
axes[0].set_title(str(s2_ds.satellite.value))
axes[1].imshow(phr_rgb)
axes[1].set_title(str(phr_ds.satellite.value))
fig.show()
 ```

## Installation

Pass the path to cloned repository to ```pip install```:

```

## Contributing

### Code quality

There is a Makefile at the root of the project that allows to run the following checkers:
* ```mypy```
* ```yapf```
* ```isort```
* ```ruff```
* ```pylint```

### Automated testing

* There are tests covering (almost) all modules. Some tests require test data that can be made available upon request due to their size. Those tests are flagged with ```@pytest.mark.requires_test_data```. Uncompress the test data to a folder and set the ```SENSORSIO_TEST_DATA_PATH``` environment variable before running the tests with ```pytest```
